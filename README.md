# My Student Projects
This repository contains all the student coding projects I worked on studying computing languages from different sources including Harvard C50 and Coursera.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** cs50.dev

## Lessons Learned:

I took an entire afternoon and evening to complete my first student project CreditCardValidator.c. This is actually the first time I ever coded in C and honestly I don't even know all the features of the language yet. It is both surprising and encouraging to know that I am capable of understanding the C language logic despite having a non-technical background. I am excited to embark on more complicated coding projects in the future. Some of the lessons I have learned:

* Code one part at a time. Break down the problem into different parts and make sure each part of the code works before proceeding to the next.
* Try to combine similar conditionals together where possible.
* Make the format neat so codes are not all over the place.
* If in doubt of a code, printf() in C will help to check if the output is as intended.
